# One-Loop 4PCF Covariance Figure Reproduction Code

This repository contains scripts used to reproduce selected numerical figures from the papers:

- **Analytical Template for the 4-Point Correlation Function Covariance Beyond the Gaussian Random Field I: 1-Loop Corrections involving Second-Order Densities**  
  arXiv:2509.05419

- **Analytical Template for the 4-Point Correlation Function Covariance Beyond the Gaussian Random Field II: 1-Loop Corrections involving Third-Order Densities**  
  arXiv:2509.05422

This repository does **not** provide a complete public implementation of the full one-loop 4PCF covariance calculation. Instead, it provides a reproducible numerical workflow for generating selected figures shown in the papers. These include convergence tests, selected radial-integral evaluations, and the scale-dependence plot showing the expected size of the one-loop correction relative to the Gaussian covariance.

## Purpose of the repository

The purpose of this repository is to make selected numerical results from the papers reproducible. In particular, the code allows the user to reproduce:

1. Convergence-test figures for selected radial-integral calculations.
2. Selected radial-integral plots used to validate the numerical pipeline.
3. The one-loop correction scale plot, which estimates the fractional size of the one-loop covariance correction relative to the Gaussian covariance as a function of scale \(R\).

The correction scale plot is intended to show at which scales the one-loop covariance contribution is expected to become a given percentage of the Gaussian covariance contribution.

## Directory descriptions

### `Convergence_Test/`

This directory contains the scripts and outputs used to reproduce selected convergence-test figures from the papers. It includes scripts for precomputing constants, computing intermediate radial-integral tables, building selected final radial-integral quantities, running convergence tests, and storing the resulting figure outputs.

This directory is organized into:

- `Computing_All_Constants/`: scripts for precomputing selected angular and tensorial constants.
- `Intermediate_Radial_Integrals/`: scripts for computing selected intermediate radial-integral tables.
- `Final_Radial_Integrals/`: scripts for computing selected final radial-integral quantities.
- `Convergence_Computation/`: scripts for running convergence tests.
- `Figure_outputs/`: generated convergence-test and diagnostic figures.

### `One_Loop_Correction_Script/`

This directory contains the notebook used to generate the one-loop correction scale plot.

The main file is:

- `One_Loop_Correction_Script/Script/NLO_Correction_Scale_Computation.ipynb`

This notebook computes and visualizes the approximate fractional size of the one-loop covariance correction relative to the Gaussian covariance as a function of scale \(R\). The resulting figure shows the scale at which the one-loop correction is expected to induce corrections of 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50% relative to the Gaussian covariance.

### `Radial_Integral_Plotting/`

This directory contains files used to reproduce selected radial-integral plots from the papers. It is organized into:

- `plotting_script/`: plotting scripts used to generate selected radial-integral figures.
- `intermediate_radial_integrals/`: intermediate radial-integral files used by the plotting scripts.
- `2nd_Order_Cov_Figures/`: generated figures associated with selected second-order covariance terms.
